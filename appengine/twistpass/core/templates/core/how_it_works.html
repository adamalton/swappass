				<h5 class="light-blue-text center">The Problem</h5>
				<p class="card-panel">
					You've probably heard or been told that you should use a different password for each
					website that you use and that the passwords should be complex and non-guessable.&nbsp;
					But remembering all of those passwords is not something that most of us are capable
					of.

				<h5 class="light-blue-text center">What TwistPass Is</h5>
				<p class="card-panel">
					TwistPass is a free tool that lets you have a different password for each website that
					you use, while only having to remember one of them.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h5 class="light-blue-text center">How It Works</h5>
		<div class="card-panel">
			<p>
				TwistPass takes 2 pieces of data: your one memorised password, and the domain name of a
				website; and puts them through a one-way mathematical algorithm to produce a unique
				result, which is a password that you can use for that website.&nbsp;
				Each time you enter your memorised password and the same domain name, TwistPass will
				produce exactly the same result.&nbsp; This means that although it never stores any of
				your data, it can always regenerate any of your passwords for you.&nbsp;

				<p>
					The algorithm is mathematically irreversible, meaning that if you log in to a
					malicious website, they can't use the generated password that you give them to
					calculate what your master password is.&nbsp;
					However, they could still use a process of trial and error in which they keep
					entering guesses of your master password into TwistPass until they get a result
					which matches the generated password that you gave them.&nbsp;
					It is for this reason that your master password should be long and obscure.&nbsp;

		<div class="section">
			<h5 class="light-blue-text">How Do I Use It?</h5>
			<p>
				Each time you find yourself signing up to yet another website and you need a password, use TwistPass to generate a you a unique password for that site using your master password.&nbsp;
				Then each time you need to log into that site, just return to TwistPass, enter your master password and the name of the site, and it will tell you what your password for that site is.&nbsp;
				You will have the security benefit of having a different password for every website that you use, but you will only ever have to remember your one master password.
			</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h5 class="light-blue-text">Can It Generate Passwords to Fit Particular Requirements?</h5>
			<p>
				Some websites require that your password to fit certain criteria.&nbsp;
				TwistPass guarantees that each password it generates for you will contain at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 digit and 1 punctuation character.&nbsp;
				However, because TwistPass never remembers your generated passwords, it cannot alter
				them to meet other arbitrary criteria.

				But don't let that put you off TwistPass, let it put you off the websites with
				those requirements.&nbsp;

			<h5 class="light-blue-text">What if I Forget My Master Password?</h5>
			<p>
				In short, you're screwed.&nbsp; If you're afraid that you'll forget your master
				password then perhaps don't change your email password to use TwistPass just
				yet.&nbsp;
				You can usually reset your password for most accounts by asking for a password
				reset link to be emailed to you.&nbsp; So keeping your existing email password
				until you've fully memorised your master password should avoid any dire problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's worth noting, that because you enter your master password into TwistPass each
				time you generate a password for an account, you will type it a lot of times, and
				will therefore become very familiar with it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h5 class="light-blue-text">Why Should I Have a Different Password for Every Website?</h5>
			<p>
				Let's assume that you use the same password for everything, your email, social
				media accounts, online shopping accounts, the lot.&nbsp; Assuming that you sign up
				for most of those accounts using your email address, that means that your login
				details for each account are identical.&nbsp; So it only takes one of those
				websites to either be mallicious, or to get hacked in a way that allows attackers
				to steal users' passwords, and your login details for all of your accounts are
				now stolen.

				The bottom line is, you should use a different password for every website that
				you use.

				We never transfer any of your data to our severs.&nbsp; Don't believe us? Go to
				the Generator page and then turn off your wifi/data connection - it still works!

				Still don't believe us?&nbsp; If you (or someone you know) can understand HTML and

		<div class="section">
			<h5 class="light-blue-text">What if I Need to Change a Password?</h5>
			<p>
				It may be that some of the services that you use require you to change your
				password after a certain amount of time.&nbsp;
				If this is the case then with TwistPass you essentially have 2 choices: you can
				either amend the generated password, or you can use a different master password
				which will generate completely different passwords for you.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>
				Given that rotating your passwords regularly is a good idea anyway, you might
				consider changing your master password once a year.&nbsp;
				This will mean that the generated passwords will all change, and so you will need
				to change the passwords for all of your accounts accordingly, but you could change
				them gradually as you log into each one, slowly transitioning to your new master
				password.&nbsp;
