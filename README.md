# SwapPass

A tool that lets you use a single password as the "salt" to generate a different password for every website or service that you use.

Essentially this is a glorified hash function, but the key is that it makes it usable by normal people who know nothing about encryption.  The purpose of the site is to bring this simple functionality to as many people as possible, rather than for it to be anything relolutionary or clever.
